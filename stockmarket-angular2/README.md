# Axway AMPLIFY Streams Angular

This sample application shows how to use the Axway AMPLIFY Streams Javascript SDK with Angular.

The Axway AMPLIFY Streams JavaScript SDK allows the use of [Axway AMPLIFY Streams](https://streamdata.io) to get data pushed from various sources and use them in your application.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.1.1.

## Testing this project

Run

```bash
$ npm install -g @angular/cli
$ npm install
$ ng serve 
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

In your browser, you will need to enter your Axway AMPLIFY Streams token. If you don't have one, you can get it for free at [Axway AMPLIFY Streams portal](https://portal.streamdata.io).

This demo uses fake market data emulated by our public API : http://stockmarket.streamdata.io/v2/prices
