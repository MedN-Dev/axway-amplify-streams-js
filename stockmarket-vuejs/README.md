# Axway AMPLIFY Streams Vue.js

This sample application shows how to use the Axway AMPLIFY Streams Javascript SDK with Vue.js.

The Axway AMPLIFY Streams JavaScript SDK allows the use of [Axway AMPLIFY Streams](https://streamdata.io) to get data pushed from various sources and use them in your application.

This project was create with [Vue CLI](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) version 2.8.0

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

## Run the demo

After running the server with npm run dev, navigate to localhost:8080. You will need to enter your Axway AMPLIFY Streams token. If you don't have one, you can get it for free at [Axway AMPLIFY Streams portal](https://portal.streamdata.io).

This demo uses fake market data emulated by our public API : http://stockmarket.streamdata.io/v2/prices
